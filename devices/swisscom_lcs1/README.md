The Swisscom Smart Switch can be thought of as the little brother to the myStrom WLAN Switch which uses an ESP32 chip.
But instead of the ESP32 soldered chip the Swisscom Smart Switch uses an ESP-WROOM-02D module and has no temperature sensor and no circuit for measuring the power consumption.

For opening the case it is best to use a Torx T10 screw driver where three edges have been grinded off to match the triangle shape of the screws. When putting it back together remember that the longer screws are at the bottom of the WLAN switch:
